# Customer_Churn
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is when someone chooses to stop using your products or services. In effect, it’s when a customer ceases to be a customer. Customer churn is measured using customer churn rate. That’s the number of people who stopped being customers during a set period of time, such as a year, a month, or a financial quarter.

# Overview
